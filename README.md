    + Fixed grammatical issues in text
+ Code quality improvements
    + Reduced obfuscation in `__init__.py` (see [here](https://github.com/atticus-lv/lightgroup_helper/blob/master/__init__.py) for the original vs [refactored](https://github.com/StandingPadAnimations/lightgroup_helper/blob/master/addon/__init__.py) file)
